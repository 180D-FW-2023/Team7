The Code

Contains the code that will be run on the scale (```main.py```), if you would like you can set this to automatically run after initial setup. A guide on how to do that can be found here:

Credit

The creation of this code was made possible with the use of openCV, Adafruit's Python libraries, and Ozzmaker's BerryIMU libaries.

Future

Further optimization of the code may be accomplished by rewriting the code in C++, this would allow for faster run time and complier optimisations. There are no known bugs at this time.
